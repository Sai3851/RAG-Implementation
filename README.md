# RAG-Implementation
Repository for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Python and FAISS
This repository contains an implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid AI architecture that combines the power of generative models with external knowledge retrieval. The notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using Python, FAISS for efficient document retrieval, and Hugging Face Transformers for response generation.
## Description
The notebook provides step-by-step guidance on implementing RAG, covering the following aspects:
* Preprocessing Documents: Tokenizing and embedding documents for efficient retrieval.
* Building FAISS Index: Creating a scalable retrieval system for domain-specific knowledge.
* Query Processing: Handling user queries and fetching relevant context.
* Response Generation: Using a Transformer-based language model to generate coherent and factual responses.
  
This implementation is ideal for applications requiring accurate, up-to-date, and domain-specific answers, such as customer support, legal/medical advisory, or enterprise solutions.
